#Operations on Sets
#Short description:
#Write a program to create a set and perform the following operations on that set- 1. Create a set with integer elements 2. Create a set with mixed data type elements 3. Create another set with elements - 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2 4. Create a set from a list with elements - [1, 2, 3, 2] 5. Print the set after removing the first element from this set - [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]
#Code:
# Different types of sets in Python
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)

# set cannot have duplicates
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
print(my_set)

# we can make set from a list
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2])
print(my_set,"\n")

#remove a number from a set
num_set = set([0, 1, 3, 4, 5])
print("Original set:")
print(num_set)
num_set.pop()
print("After removing the first element from the said set:")
print(num_set,"\n")
